    (Ps 31:9-18) 9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in <span style="color: blue;">trouble</span>: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. 10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a <span style="color: skyblue;">fear</span>  to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. 13 For I have heard the <span style="color: rgb(249, 108, 136);">slander</span> of many: <span style="color: rgb(0, 179, 255);">fear</span>  was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 14 But I  <span style="color: violet;">trusted</span> in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. 15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 16 Make thy face to <span style="color: yellow;">shine</span> upon thy servant: save me for thy merciesâ€™ sake. 17 Let me not be <span style="color: lawngreen;">ashamed</span>, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be <span style="color: green;">ashamed</span>, and let them be silent in the grave. 18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
